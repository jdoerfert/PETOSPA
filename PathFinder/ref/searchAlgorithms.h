/* findNextLabel is a recursive method that determines if a path exists between a
 * specific node and the label that is at the start of the label array argument. The
 * label array is an array of char pointers that is terminated with a NULL pointer. The
 * first pointer is the "current" label.
 *
 * The node's edge nodes are checked against the current label. If none of them match, then
 * this method recurses with each edge node and the current label.
 *
 * If an edge matches, then we are beginning a search for the next "leg" of the labels.
 * We recurse with that specific edge and the "next" label. That is the [1] element of
 * the label array. If that element is NULL, the matching edge signifies the end of our
 * search! VICTORY!
 *
 * If we reach the last edge with out a match (directly or recursively) we return a false
 * list.
